üåê Role: System Integrator & Alert Engineer
üéØ Goal
Connect the entire system together so that:

The ESP32‚Äôs dust sensor data and the AI mask detection results communicate seamlessly

The system decides when masks are required

Alerts are triggered if someone isn‚Äôt wearing a mask when they should be

‚úÖ Responsibilities (Step-by-Step)
1. Build a communication bridge
Create a Flask server (or use MQTT broker) on your laptop to:

Receive dust data from the ESP32

Optionally, receive data from the AI system

Example Flask route to receive JSON:

python
Copy
Edit
@app.route('/sensor-data', methods=['POST'])
def receive_data():
    data = request.json
    pm_value = data['pm25']
    mask_required = data['mask_required']
    # store and act on this
2. Manage shared state
Maintain global variables like:

python
Copy
Edit
latest_pm25 = 102
mask_required = True
These values will be used by the mask detection system to decide whether to trigger alerts

3. Build the alert logic
If:

mask_required == True AND

AI detects a person without a mask

‚ûù Show a clear alert

Terminal printout

Pop-up window

Sound alert

Save log to file

Optional: use tkinter, pygame, notify2, or winsound for alert visuals/sounds

4. Optional: Build a dashboard
If you want extra spice, build a simple GUI or web dashboard showing:

Current air quality

Number of people detected

Number of violations

Use Streamlit or Flask + HTML

üìÅ Deliverables
server/flask_receiver.py: Flask app to receive sensor data

server/shared_state.py: Logic for mask/dust thresholds

ui/alerts.py: Module for visual/audio alerting

logs/violations.log: Optional alert history log

üß∞ Tech Stack
Python (Flask, threading, requests)

REST or MQTT

Alerting tools (tkinter, Streamlit, winsound, playsound, etc.)

Logging module

ü§ù Collaboration Points
Receives air quality data from the Hardware Engineer

Receives mask detection results from the AI Engineer

Merges them and handles alert logic

üî• Stretch Goals (Optional)
Add a web interface to show real-time data

Add charts (e.g., Matplotlib or Chart.js)

Deploy on a Raspberry Pi or local server for real-time use
